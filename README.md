# Replace Anything

A simple web application that lets you replace any part of an image with an image generated based on your description.

‚úÇÔ∏è Generate a mask using the Segment Anything Model ([SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#getting-started)) by Meta AI Research. SAM is able to accurately identify and isolate the specific areas of the image that you want to edit.

üé® Replace the specific parts of the image based on a text prompt using Diffusers library [Inpaint Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/inpaint) by Hugging Face. This ensures smooth and seamless blending of the edited portions with the rest of the image, resulting in a natural and realistic final product.
